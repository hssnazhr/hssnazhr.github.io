        <h3>EV Vehicle Sales Impact on Oil Displacement</h3>
        <p>This personal project for Solarable (a growing start-up focusing on increasing solar energy accessibility, solving everyday problems using renewable energy, and data-driven solutions) analyzes global electric vehicle sales and their impact on oil displacement, showcasing the trends and predictions for future market behavior.<p>

        <p> China's comprehensive and multi-faceted policies, including mandates, financial incentives, infrastructure development, and industrial support, have collectively driven the rapid adoption of EVs. These policies are central to reducing the country's reliance on oil for transportation, leading to significant oil displacement and setting an example for other nations looking to transition to cleaner energy sources. The screenshot below is the dashboard I have created using PowerBI.</p>
